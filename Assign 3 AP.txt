Assignment 3: Quizzer
Description
Extend Assignment 1 to use Spring (Application Framework) and Hibernate (ORM). All the quizzes should be persistently stored in a DB and the user should be able to select any available quiz, attempt it and record his achieved score for future reference.

All functional requirements from assignment 1 will be applied here as well. Serialization will be replaced by an ORM (and DBMS). All functions will be made available via RESTFul Web Services(running on localhost) and the view will remain independent of the spring application(communication should be done via AJAX and JSON).
